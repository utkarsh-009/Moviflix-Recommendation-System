# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM MODEL AND API

## 📄 Description

- The Movie Recommendation Model is created using Python Language with scikit-learn machine learning package. 

- Using the above machine learning model, I created an API using Flask framework and hosted it on Heroku. 

- The Flask API will fetch JSON data of the movies that are most similar to the movie provided in the url

#### 📜 Libraries and Dependencies Used:
- Pandas dependency was used for loading CSV into Data Frame.
- From Flask package jsonify, request functions were imported
- The Difflib and scikit-learn libraries were used for building ml model. 
- From scikit-learn library TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity were imported.
- Beautiful Soup package for Web Scrapping (to extract additional data like movie poster from imdb websites).
